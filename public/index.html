        <p class="font-weight-700 text-black my-2 pb-1">The Insights tab of your GitHub repository gives you a
          comprehensive, and high-level, overview of what is happening in your repository. You can find easily at hand,
          recent activity, traffic, contributor information, dependency, download information and community health.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-700 text-black my-2 pb-1">The first step in ensuring your repository is ready for contributors can be found in the community standards section. The community standards ensure that your repository has all the required items and files that new contributors to your project will be looking for.

        <p class="font-weight-700 text-black my-2 pb-1">New contributors to your project are going to expect a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>
          file in your project that explains to them the ins and outs of contributing. This file should contain, at a minimum, the process by which
          contributors will submit their code contributions and the requirements of doing that. You should also clearly lay out if your project
          expects contributors to fork the project and then submit a pull request or if your project adds contributors to the project so they
          can submit a branch. If your project needs specific software or requires specific operating systems to be able to develop and 
          contribute it should be clearly laid out in this file.</p>

        <hr class="hr-thick mb-0">
        <p class="font-weight-700 text-black my-2 pb-1">
          Issues are where contributors come and see what tasks there are and 
          how they can contribute to your project. This is also an opportunity to build a relationship with contributors by
          connecting the work they will be doing to the mission or stakeholders your project is serving. A well written issue
          should contain three key sections. The first is that it should explain the task that is to be completed by the contributor
          that is ideally written in a way that ties the work to be done back to social sector work of the project. Second
          is to add in a section with the information that will help the contributor, who may not have a full understanding of the
          domain, successful solve the problem. Finally, it should be clearly spelled out what is required to successful complete 
          the issue. <a href="https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials/issues/2895">Here</a> is an example of an issue containing a summary, additional information, and completion details.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-700 text-black my-2 pb-1">
          If your project allows contributors who are not part of your core team to submit issues we recomment that your issue 
          templates adds in additional sections. We recommend having a section for the contributor to submit a justification for
          the requested issue to be added as well as a section for the contributor to add in any research or code details that
          may be relevant in solving this issue. <a href="https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-scripts/issues/129">Here</a> is 
          an example of a contributor submitted issue containing a justification and code details.

        <hr class="hr-thick mb-0">
        <p class="font-weight-700 text-black my-2 pb-1">
          Labels provide an easy way for contributors to identify both the types issues that they are
          interested in working on as well as if those issues are ready to be worked on. We recommend
          that you have a set of labels that you can attach to issues that provide a high level overview
          of the type of work that needs to be done. For example, if you are working on a project that
          is a website you may have labels for "Frontend", "Backend", "Design", "Documentation", etc.
          With labels like this contributors can easily identify the type of work they are interested in
          combine that with the labels like "Ready to Work" and "Help Wanted" that indicate if the issue is ready to be worked on and your project will be a breeze for contributors to navigate.
          <p>
        <p class="font-weight-700 text-black my-2 pb-1">
          By creating a custom "Hacktoberfest" label you can also make it easy for contributors to identify issues that are specifically designated for Hacktoberfest. During October contributors look specifically for this label as contributing to projects that are participating in Hacktoberfest is rewarded with some developer swag.
      </p>
        <p class="font-weight-700 text-black my-2 pb-1">
          If you use GitHub project boards to manage your issues you can take advantage of GitHub actions to automatically add labels to issues as they are added to the project board. You can also use GitHub actions to automatically add labels to issues that have been inactive for a certain amount of time as well as adding or removing Help Wanted labels when an issue becomes available or claimed.

          Hacktoberfest is an amazing, and hectic, time.
          Some projects see a huge influx of contributors and it can be hard to keep up with the volume of
          issues and pull requests. It is recommended that you have a set of guidelines for contributors to follow
          to make sure that they are contributing in a way that is helpful to your project and that they know you
          will be responsive to your contributors.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-700 text-black my-2 pb-1">
          We recommend that you have a section in your README that outlines any special guidelines for Hacktoberfest contributors. This section should also include how soon they can expect to have their
          questions answered and their pull requests reviewed.
